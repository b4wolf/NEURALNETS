# NEURALNETS
## Data
The data needed is housed within the WI_weather_coords, clean_WI_data, and preprocessed_pm.
## Running Code
To run our LSTM and GNN code, use model_lstm_12_7.ipynb.  
The imports and downloads are designed to be run twice, once for the LSTM and once for the Graph. Running cells sequentially is a necessity.  
All sections of the code are labelled with the task they are associated with.

Ensure that the appropriate preprocessing has done, either with the files already provided in 'preprocessed_PM' or in other directories for creating more particulate data of the appropriate shape to enter the Network system. 

To run the multidimensional LSTM, use working_copy_PMWeather.ipynb and upload the previously mentioned directories in the data section to Colab (use the same names).  

Running each cell should produce correct output and figures.
