# NEURALNETS
## Data
The data needed is housed within the WI_weather_coords, clean_WI_data, and preprocessed_pm.
## Running Code
To run our LSTM and GNN code, use model_lstm_12_7.ipynb.  
[brandon's explanation]  

To run the multidimensional LSTM, use working_copy_PMWeather.ipynb and upload the previously mentioned directories in the data section to Colab (use the same names).  

Running each cell should produce correct output and figures.
